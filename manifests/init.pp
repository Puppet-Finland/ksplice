#
# == Class: ksplice
#
# Install and configure ksplice. This module depends on the "puppetlabs/apt"
# and "puppetlabs/stdlib" modules:
#
# <https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt>
# <https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib>
#
# WARNING: Oracle has bastardized ksplice for platforms other than "Oracle 
# Unbreakable Linux". The Ubuntu version of ksplice pulls with it tons of 
# desktop dependencies, thus rendering it useless on servers. Circumventing 
# these restrictions would probably violate the kpslice EULA. Therefore this 
# module is pretty much useless and available here only for reference.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*accesskey*]
#   The Ksplice Uptrack access key for this host.
# [*proxy_url*]
#   The proxy URL used for fetching the ksplice software repository public 
#   keys. For example "http://proxy.domain.com:8888". Not needed if the node has 
#   direct Internet connectivity, or if you're installing ksplice from your 
#   operating system repositories. Defaults to 'none' (do not use a proxy).
